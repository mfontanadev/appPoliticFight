# App "Politic Fight"
 
Platform game (only first level) using my own game engine (POC) based on HTML + Javascript. It can be used as a template. 

## Enjoy at

## Motivation
- Develop a simple game engine using HTML + Javascript.
- Inspect http://spritedatabase.net (sprite sheets of arcade games).
- See Raiden fight against Cody.

## Building a new version

The idea is copy all relevand files to a single folder. To do that, you can use batch file.

1. Go to root dir and locate build.bat (this works on Windows). Run as is to get help or provide version name parameter. Example: build.bat v3.1.4.

NOTE: if you want to set version number inside de app, please modify this line "Politic Fight (v2.1.16)" from file index.html, this is a very simple way to identify it at running time.

2. Finally, find inside "build" dir, the directory name used in step 1.
